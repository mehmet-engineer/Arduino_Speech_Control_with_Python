# Arduino Control Software with Python Voice Command
March 2021 â€“ April 2021

In this application, serial communication between Laptop and Arduino is in question over UART protocol. Python detects our voice command, interprets the command and sends data to Arduino. Thus, the desired LEDs can be controlled without any effort. I added some speech features to our voice assistant to make commands more human. Thus, it is possible to turn the LEDs on and off with chat.
